## Features in Progress

Travel Keep is a fully functional tool for brainstorming and organizing travel ideas. However, there are more features coming, including:

- Ability to see and add activities or points of interest to travel ideas
- Ability to select a flight for a planned destination
- Ability to create an itinerary and book hotel and/or car rentals
- Mobile device optimizations

## Known Issues

Fixes are in progress for these known issues, mainly with the Amadeus free membership plan:

- Mostly popular cities will be found in the destination search.
- When searching a flight price analysis on saved travels, it will take some time to load the result. An error message alerts the user to wait a few minutes before searching again due to the Amadeus API network rate limit.
